# Weather App

This is a full-stack weather application built using **Next.js** (frontend) and **Laravel** (backend API). It allows users to search for real-time weather data for any city globally and toggle between temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit). This project was developed as part of an interview assessment.

---

## Features

* **City Search** â€“ Search weather conditions for any city
* **Unit Toggle** â€“ Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit
* **Forecast View** â€“ 3-day weather forecast
* **Additional Info** â€“ View wind speed and humidity
* **Live Updates** â€“ Data fetched from OpenWeatherMap API
* **Responsive UI** â€“ Built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **Next.js 14** with App Router (`app/` directory)
* **React 18** (Client Components)
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **Lucide-react** for icons

### Backend

* **Laravel 11** (API routes)
* **OpenWeatherMap API** integration

## Project Structure

```
weather-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx            # Main weather page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx          # App shell layout
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Navbar.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CurrentWeather.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ForecastCard.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AdditionalInfo.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getWeather.ts       # Fetches data from backend API
â”œâ”€â”€ interface/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WeatherData.ts      # Type definitions
â””â”€â”€ public/
    â””â”€â”€ assets/             # Static files (e.g., icons)
```

## How It Works

1. **User enters a city** in the search bar
2. **Frontend** calls a `getWeather` function which fetches weather data from your **Laravel API**
3. **Laravel** forwards the request to **OpenWeatherMap**, processes it, and returns simplified JSON
4. Data is displayed in a clean, responsive UI with **unit toggling** and **forecast breakdown**

## Setup & Installation

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend (Laravel)

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Set your OpenWeatherMap API key in .env
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Start the server
php artisan serve
```
